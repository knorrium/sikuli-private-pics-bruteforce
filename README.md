sikuli-private-pics-bruteforce
==============================

Sikuli script to bruteforce my own password for the Private Pics iPhone app.

It required the iPhone to be Jailbroken and have VNC enabled in order to interact with the phone from the computer.

After connecting to the phone, Sikuli would click on all possible combinations, one by one, until it found the password.

This repo is not useful anymore but is here for learning purposes.
